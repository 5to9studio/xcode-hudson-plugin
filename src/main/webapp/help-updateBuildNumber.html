    Make sure CFBundleShortVersionString is set in your Info.plist to an appropriate marketing version number (e.g. 1.0).  Checking this box will update the current project version in the project file as well as the CFBundleVersion in the Info.plist to the marketing version suffixed with the build number (e.g. 1.0.3234)
